# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and other amenities.

## Data

The data used to train the model is included in the `data` folder, and consists of a CSV file containing information on house prices and features.

## Model

The model is built using a variety of regression techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The Jupyter notebook `house_price_prediction.ipynb` contains the code used to train and evaluate the model.

## Usage

To run the code and reproduce the results, you can follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the necessary packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Navigate to the `src` folder and run `jupyter notebook` to start the notebook server.
4.  Open the `app.ipynb` notebook and run the cells.

## Results

The trained model achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 50,000 on the test data, indicating that it can predict house prices with reasonable accuracy.
